    <p style="color: gray; font-style: normal;margin-left: 500px;margin-top: 70px;">As I mentioned above I love journaling As it helps me to think better! I love collecting stationary for my journals and decorating them.I think Hobby should not always be productive.It can be anything that makes YOU feel better in your leisure time! It could be anything.One more thing about me is that I love to "Read" But honestly I prefer movies over Books.Idk It's better to watch it with thrilling sounds and pictures than only words.And yeah that was all about my interests and hobbies!</p>
